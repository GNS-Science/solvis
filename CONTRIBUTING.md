Solvis could always use more documentation, whether as part of the

articles, and such.

The project has Markdown-based documentation, using
[MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/user-guide/) with
[mkdocstrings-python](https://mkdocstrings.github.io/python/) in the
[Google](https://mkdocstrings.github.io/griffe/docstrings/) style.

### Submit Feedback

The best way to send feedback is to file an issue at [https://github.com/GNS-Science/solvis/issues](https://github.com/GNS-Science/solvis/issues).

If you are proposing a feature:

- Explain in detail how it would work.
- Keep the scope as narrow as possible, to make it easier to implement.
